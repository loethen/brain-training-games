## 🧠 Why This Project?

This repository contains the source code for [FreeFocusGames.com](https://www.freefocusgames.com), a collection of cognitive exercises designed to improve:
*   **Working Memory**
*   **Attention Span**
*   **Processing Speed**
*   **Cognitive Flexibility**

Unlike many proprietary brain training apps, this project provides transparent, scientific implementations of classic cognitive psychology paradigms.

## 🎮 Included Games & Algorithms

This repository features production-ready implementations of the following cognitive tasks:

### 1. [Dual N-Back](/app/[locale]/(main)/games/dual-n-back)
The gold standard for working memory training. Based on the research by Susanne Jaeggi, this task requires users to simultaneously track visual and auditory stimuli sequences.
*   **Keywords**: *Fluid Intelligence, Working Memory, Jaime Jaeggi, N-Back Algorithm*

### 2. [Schulte Table](/app/[locale]/(main)/games/schulte-table)
A grid of randomly distributed numbers used for speed reading development and peripheral vision training.
*   **Keywords**: *Speed Reading, Attention Control, Peripheral Vision, Focus Grid*

### 3. [Stroop Effect Test](/app/[locale]/(main)/games/stroop-effect-test)
A neuropsychological test demonstrating the reaction time delay between congruent and incongruent stimuli. Measures cognitive flexibility and executive function.
*   **Keywords**: *Selective Attention, Cognitive Flexibility, Executive Function, Inhibition Control*

### 4. [Reaction Time Test](/app/[locale]/(main)/games/reaction-time)
A millisecond-precision test to measure your reaction speed. Click as fast as you can when the screen changes color. Widely used in sports science and cognitive research.
*   **Keywords**: *Reaction Time, Reflex Test, Speed Test, Response Time, Human Benchmark*

### 5. Other Cognitive Tasks
*   **Pomodoro Timer**: Focus timer based on the Pomodoro Technique.
*   **Block Memory Challenge**: Spatial working memory exercise.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
