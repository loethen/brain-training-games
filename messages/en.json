        },
        "readingHelp": {
          "question": "How does this help with reading speed?",
          "answer": "By training your peripheral vision, you can perceive more text at once while reading. This reduces the number of eye movements needed, allowing you to process information faster and read more efficiently."

        "research": {
          "question": "Is this exercise backed by research?",

        "peripheralVision": {
          "question": "What is peripheral vision and why is it important?",
          "answer": "Peripheral vision is your ability to perceive information at the edges of your visual field without looking directly at it. It's crucial in daily life for activities like driving (noticing surrounding vehicles), reading (capturing more text at once), and sports (being aware of teammates' positions). Strong peripheral vision improves your spatial awareness, reaction time, and ability to distribute attention effectively."

          "question": "How is this different from the regular Dual N-Back?",
          "answer": "While maintaining the core dual n-back mechanics of tracking position and audio stimuli, our version incorporates authentic mahjong tiles and a traditional green felt background. This cultural theming makes the exercise more visually engaging while preserving the cognitive challenge that makes dual n-back effective."
        },
        "practice": {
          "question": "How often should I practice with the mahjong tiles?",
          "answer": "For optimal results, aim for 20-30 minutes of mahjong dual n-back training, 3-4 times per week. Consistency is more important than duration. Regular practice helps your brain build stronger neural pathways for working memory tasks involving both visual position and auditory processing."

        "what": {
          "question": "What is reaction time?",
          "answer": "Reaction time is the interval between perceiving a stimulus (like seeing the screen turn green) and making a physical response (like clicking). It includes the time your brain takes to process visual information, decide to act, and send signals to your muscles. Average human reaction time to visual stimuli is typically between 200-250 milliseconds, though this varies by individual and circumstances."
        },
        "limitations": {
          "question": "What are the limitations of this test?",
          "answer": "This test only measures simple reaction time, not choice reaction time or complex decision-making. Results are affected by hardware (monitor refresh rate, mouse/touchscreen latency), environmental factors, and personal state (like fatigue level), so it shouldn't be considered a precise scientific measurement."
        },
        "factors": {
          "question": "What factors affect reaction time?",
          "answer": "Many factors influence reaction time, including age (typically peaks in your 20s and gradually lengthens afterward), sleep quality, attention level, diet, medications, fatigue, and alertness during testing. Your hardware also affects measurements, with gaming monitors and professional equipment potentially providing faster results than typical devices."
        },
        "significance": {
          "question": "What's the significance of reaction time testing?",
          "answer": "Reaction time testing provides a way to understand your basic neural response speed. It can serve as a personal baseline but shouldn't be viewed as a training tool. If you notice your reaction time becoming significantly slower, it may be an indicator of fatigue, distraction, or other health factors. For professional competitors or certain occupations, understanding reaction time may have reference value."

        "whyDifficult": {
          "question": "Why is this test difficult?",
          "answer": "Reading is such an automatic process that your brain naturally wants to process the word's meaning first. When the word says 'GREEN' but is colored red, your brain has to work harder to ignore the word meaning and focus only on the color."
