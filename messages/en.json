          "answer": "Dual N-Back has been studied extensively in cognitive neuroscience. Research published in PNAS (2008) suggested that training with this task can improve fluid intelligence. Our mahjong-themed version combines position and audio matching with traditional mahjong aesthetics to create an engaging cognitive workout."

        "difference": {
          "question": "How is this different from the regular Dual N-Back?",
          "answer": "While maintaining the core dual n-back mechanics of tracking position and audio stimuli, our version incorporates authentic mahjong tiles and a traditional green felt background. This cultural theming makes the exercise more visually engaging while preserving the cognitive challenge that makes dual n-back effective."
        },
        "practice": {
          "question": "How often should I practice with the mahjong tiles?",
          "answer": "For optimal results, aim for 20-30 minutes of mahjong dual n-back training, 3-4 times per week. Consistency is more important than duration. Regular practice helps your brain build stronger neural pathways for working memory tasks involving both visual position and auditory processing."

        "improvements": {
          "question": "Will I see improvements in my daily life from mahjong memory training?",
          "answer": "Many users report improvements in concentration, multitasking ability, and information retention after regular practice with dual n-back exercises. The position and audio tracking skills developed here can transfer to academic, professional, and everyday activities requiring attention to multiple streams of information."

          "question": "Do I need to know how to play mahjong to use this training game?",

While we use the beautiful visual elements of traditional mahjong tiles, the cognitive task focuses on remembering positions and sounds rather than mahjong gameplay. The exercise is designed to be accessible to everyone regardless of their familiarity with mahjong."
