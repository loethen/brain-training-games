                "description": "Box Breathing works by activating the parasympathetic nervous system through controlled breath holds. The 4-second hold periods allow CO2 levels to rise slightly, which triggers a calming vagal response. Research shows this technique can reduce cortisol levels by up to 25% in just 5 minutes. It's one of the most evidence-based breathing techniques for acute stress management.",
