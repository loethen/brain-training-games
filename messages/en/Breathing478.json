                "description": "Developed by Dr. Andrew Weil, the 4-7-8 technique leverages the power of extended exhalation to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. The prolonged exhale (8 seconds) stimulates the vagus nerve more strongly than the inhale, creating a net calming effect. The 7-second hold allows oxygen to saturate the bloodstream more fully while increasing CO2 tolerance. Clinical studies show it can reduce the time to fall asleep by up to 50%.",

                    "answer": "Box Breathing uses equal 4-4-4-4 timing and is best for alertness and focus under stress. 4-7-8 breathing uses asymmetric timing with a longer hold and exhale, making it better for relaxation and sleep. Both are on this site — try both to see which works for you."
