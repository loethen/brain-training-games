        "howItWorks": {
          "question": "How does the Schulte Table work?",
          "answer": "The Schulte Table trains your brain to process visual information more efficiently by forcing you to maintain focus while using peripheral vision to locate numbers quickly."

        },
        "readingHelp": {
          "question": "How does this help with reading speed?",
          "answer": "By training your peripheral vision, you can perceive more text at once while reading. This reduces the number of eye movements needed, allowing you to process information faster and read more efficiently."
        },
        "research": {
          "question": "Is this exercise backed by research?",
          "answer": "Yes, the Schulte Table has been used in cognitive psychology for decades. Research shows it effectively improves visual attention, processing speed, and can help with conditions like ADHD by strengthening attention networks."
        },
        "peripheralVision": {
          "question": "What is peripheral vision and why is it important?",
          "answer": "Peripheral vision is your ability to perceive information at the edges of your visual field without looking directly at it. It's crucial in daily life for activities like driving (noticing surrounding vehicles), reading (capturing more text at once), and sports (being aware of teammates' positions). Strong peripheral vision improves your spatial awareness, reaction time, and ability to distribute attention effectively."

        "practice": {
          "question": "How often should I practice with the mahjong tiles?",
          "answer": "For optimal results, aim for 20-30 minutes of mahjong dual n-back training, 3-4 times per week. Consistency is more important than duration. Regular practice helps your brain build stronger neural pathways for working memory tasks involving both visual position and auditory processing."

Average human reaction time to visual stimuli is typically between 200-250 milliseconds, though this varies by individual and circumstances."

Results are affected by hardware (monitor refresh rate, mouse/touchscreen latency), environmental factors, and personal state (like fatigue level), so it shouldn't be considered a precise scientific measurement."
        },
        "factors": {
          "question": "What factors affect reaction time?",
          "answer": "Many factors influence reaction time, including age (typically peaks in your 20s and gradually lengthens afterward), sleep quality, attention level, diet, medications, fatigue, and alertness during testing. Your hardware also affects measurements, with gaming monitors and professional equipment potentially providing faster results than typical devices."
        },
        "significance": {
          "question": "What's the significance of reaction time testing?",
          "answer": "Reaction time testing provides a way to understand your basic neural response speed. It can serve as a personal baseline but shouldn't be viewed as a training tool. If you notice your reaction time becoming significantly slower, it may be an indicator of fatigue, distraction, or other health factors. For professional competitors or certain occupations, understanding reaction time may have reference value."

          "answer": "The Stroop effect is a phenomenon where it takes longer to identify the color of a word when the word's meaning conflicts with its color (e.g., the word 'RED' printed in blue). This demonstrates how automatic reading processes can interfere with color identification."
        },
        "whyDifficult": {
          "question": "Why is this test difficult?",
          "answer": "Reading is such an automatic process that your brain naturally wants to process the word's meaning first. When the word says 'GREEN' but is colored red, your brain has to work harder to ignore the word meaning and focus only on the color."
        },
        "howToImprove": {
          "question": "How can I improve my performance?",
          "answer": "Practice regularly to strengthen your selective attention skills. Try to develop strategies like focusing on the color immediately without reading the word, or using peripheral vision to see the color without processing the text."
        },
        "realWorldApps": {
          "question": "How does this apply to real life?",
          "answer": "The cognitive skills trained in the Stroop test transfer to many real-world situations requiring selective attention, such as driving (ignoring distractions), studying (focusing amid noise), or work (concentrating on priorities despite interruptions)."

        "description": "Developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, the Pomodoro Technique is based on the principle that frequent breaks improve mental agility. Research shows that sustained attention naturally declines after 20-30 minutes, making timed intervals optimal for maintaining focus and preventing cognitive fatigue.",

        "whatIsPomodoro": {
          "question": "What is the Pomodoro Technique?",
          "answer": "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. Each interval is called a 'pomodoro', named after the tomato-shaped timer Francesco Cirillo used when he developed the technique."
        },
        "whyBreaks": {
          "question": "Why are breaks important?",
          "answer": "Regular breaks prevent mental fatigue and maintain high levels of focus throughout the day. Research shows that sustained attention declines after extended periods, so breaks help reset your cognitive resources and maintain productivity."
        },
        "customize": {
          "question": "Can I customize the timer duration?",
          "answer": "Yes! Click the Settings button to adjust focus duration (1-60 minutes), short break (1-30 minutes), long break (1-60 minutes), and how many sessions before a long break. Customize based on your task type and attention capacity."
        },
        "bestFor": {
          "question": "What tasks work best with Pomodoro?",
          "answer": "The Pomodoro Technique works well for tasks requiring sustained focus: writing, coding, studying, design work, and problem-solving. It's less suitable for tasks requiring extended creative flow or tasks with frequent interruptions."
        },
        "howManyPerDay": {
          "question": "How many pomodoros should I do per day?",
          "answer": "Most people complete 8-12 pomodoros in a workday (4-6 hours of focused work). Start with a lower number and gradually increase. Quality matters more than quantity - it's better to complete fewer highly focused sessions than many distracted ones."
