                    "answer": "Not entirely. To reach limits (like 10+ CPS) and stay consistent, your brain must be highly focused to control micro-movements. Any momentary distraction drops your speed, making this a test of high-intensity short-term focus."

                    "question": "Is this a good brain warmup?",
                    "answer": "Yes. Short bursts of clicking (like the 5s mode) quickly activate the nervous system and wake up the cerebral cortex, helping you transition from a groggy state to a ready-to-work state."
