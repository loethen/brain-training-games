                    "answer": "Resonance breathing (also called coherent breathing) is a slow-paced breathing technique at approximately 6 breaths per minute. This specific rate creates 'baroreflex resonance' - a state where your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing synchronize, maximizing heart rate variability and activating your vagus nerve."

                    "question": "Why 6 breaths per minute?",
                    "answer": "Research shows that breathing at approximately 0.1 Hz (about 6 breaths per minute) coincides with the natural resonance frequency of the cardiovascular system. This rate maximizes the amplitude of heart rate oscillations and creates the strongest vagal stimulation."

                    "question": "What benefits can I expect?",
                    "answer": "Regular practice can lead to: reduced anxiety and stress, improved focus and mental clarity, better sleep quality, lower blood pressure, enhanced athletic recovery, and increased emotional regulation. Many users notice immediate calming effects within the first session."
