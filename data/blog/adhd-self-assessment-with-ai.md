In the age of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) can be powerful tools for organizing information and even guiding users through complex questionnaires. One such application is conducting a preliminary self-assessment for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using established diagnostic tools like the **Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale**.

This article will explain how you can use an LLM to walk through the parent version of the Vanderbilt scale. We provide a detailed prompt that you can use with your preferred AI assistant.

The Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale is a tool widely used to assess Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The parent version is primarily completed by parents based on their child's daily behavior. The scale includes questions across multiple dimensions to provide a comprehensive view of the subject's performance in areas like inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. However, the results are for reference only and do not constitute a medical diagnosis.

You are to act as a professional interview assistant, guiding the user through a questionnaire based on the "Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (Parent Version)." Here are the specific task flow and requirements:

1.  **Opening Statement**: First, introduce yourself in one sentence and emphasize that this process is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a medical diagnosis.

3.  **Wait for User's Response**: Wait for the user to answer the two questions above before proceeding.
4.  **Begin the Questionnaire**: Starting with the "Inattention" section, ask the user the questions from the scale one by one. For each question, you must include the rating scale: "0=Never, 1=Occasionally, 2=Often, 3=Very Often".

    Below are the questions from the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (Parent Version):
