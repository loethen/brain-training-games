The **Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1)** represents the most widely validated and clinically accepted screening instrument for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults worldwide. Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with leading ADHD researchers, this comprehensive tool has transformed adult ADHD assessment and recognition.

With adult ADHD affecting approximately **3.1% of adults globally** according to recent comprehensive meta-analyses, the ASRS-v1.1 provides healthcare professionals and individuals with a scientifically robust method for identifying ADHD symptoms in adults aged 18 and above.

## What is the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1)?

The **Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale version 1.1 (ASRS-v1.1)** is an 18-item symptom checklist developed by the World Health Organization as part of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO CIDI). This validated screening tool evaluates the presence and frequency of ADHD symptoms in adults based on DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria.

### Key Features of ASRS-v1.1

**Comprehensive Assessment:**
- **18 symptom items** covering all DSM-5 ADHD criteria
- **Two-part structure**: 6-item screener (Part A) plus 12 additional items (Part B)
- **Self-report format**: Designed for independent completion by adults
- **5-point frequency scale**: Never (0) to Very Often (4)

**Scientific Foundation:**
- **WHO-developed**: Created by global health experts
- **Validated globally**: Extensive research across diverse populations
- **Evidence-based scoring**: Specific thresholds based on clinical studies
- **Multiple language versions**: Available in numerous languages worldwide

The ASRS-v1.1 uniquely addresses the challenge of adult ADHD recognition, as symptoms often manifest differently in adults compared to children, requiring specialized assessment approaches.

## Development History and WHO Collaboration

### World Health Organization Initiative

The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale emerged from a collaborative effort between the **World Health Organization** and leading ADHD researchers, including Dr. Ronald C. Kessler at Harvard Medical School. This international initiative aimed to create a standardized, globally applicable tool for adult ADHD screening.

### Research Foundation

The scale's development involved extensive validation studies, with the landmark research published in *Psychological Medicine* in 2005. The original validation study examined **154 respondents** from the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), establishing the scientific foundation for the tool's clinical applications.

2. **Support Global Application**: Function effectively across diverse cultures and healthcare systems
3. **Maintain Scientific Rigor**: Demonstrate strong psychometric properties and validation
4. **Facilitate Clinical Use**: Integrate seamlessly into clinical practice and primary care settings

## Structure and Components

### Part A: 6-Item Screener

The ASRS-v1.1 features a unique two-part structure, with **Part A serving as a highly efficient screener**:

**Questions 1-6 (Screening Items):**
1. How often do you have trouble wrapping up the final details of a project?
2. How often do you have difficulty getting things in order when you have to do a task that requires organization?
3. How often do you have problems remembering appointments or obligations?
4. When you have a task that requires a lot of thought, how often do you avoid or delay getting started?
5. How often do you fidget or squirm with your hands or feet when you have to sit down for a long time?
6. How often do you feel overly active and compelled to do things, like you were driven by a motor?

### Part B: Additional 12 Items

**Questions 7-18 (Comprehensive Assessment):**
- Items 7-12: Additional inattention symptoms
- Items 13-18: Additional hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms

### Symptom Domains Covered

**Inattention Symptoms (Items 1-4, 7-11):**
- Difficulty with task completion and organization

## Scoring and Interpretation

### ASRS-v1.1 Scoring Method

The ASRS-v1.1 uses a sophisticated scoring approach with **different thresholds for different items**:

**Part A Scoring (Screening):**
- Questions 1, 2, 3: Threshold ≥ 2 ("Sometimes" or higher)
- Questions 4, 5, 6: Threshold ≥ 3 ("Often" or higher)

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- **≥ 4 items meeting threshold in Part A**: High likelihood of ADHD (warrants clinical evaluation)
- **2-3 items meeting threshold**: Moderate likelihood (consider further assessment)
- **< 2 items meeting threshold**: Lower likelihood of ADHD

### Evidence-Based Thresholds

These specific thresholds were established through rigorous statistical analysis of clinical validation data, ensuring optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity for adult ADHD detection.

### Full Scale Scoring

**Total Score Calculation:**
- Sum of all 18 items (range: 0-72)
- Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity
- Useful for tracking symptom changes over time

### Adult ADHD Worldwide Statistics

Recent comprehensive meta-analyses reveal significant global prevalence of adult ADHD:

**Global Prevalence Data (2024):**
- **Overall adult ADHD prevalence: 3.1%** (95% CI: 2.6-3.6%)
- Based on analysis of **over 21 million adults** across 57 unique studies
- Consistent findings across diverse populations and geographical regions

**Citation:** Song, P., Zha, M., Yang, Q., Zhang, Y., Li, X., & Rudan, I. (2021). The prevalence of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A global systematic review and meta-analysis. *Journal of Global Health*, 11, 04009. [DOI: 10.7189/jogh.11.04009](https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.04009)

### Demographic Considerations

**Age and Gender Patterns:**
- Higher prevalence in younger adults
- Gender differences less pronounced in adults compared to children
- Cultural and socioeconomic factors influence recognition and diagnosis

**Clinical Significance:**
Adult ADHD prevalence exceeds that of many other well-recognized mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder (1%), emphasizing the importance of effective screening tools like the ASRS-v1.1.
